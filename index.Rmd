title: "A Look at Single Family Housing Prices Across Buffalo"

# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to look at single family housing in the City of Buffalo. Using the assessed values of single family properties (City Assessment Rolls), this project aims to examine the spatial distribution and percent change of single family housing prices across the city of Buffalo. To extend this study, median household prices within neighborhoods will also be calculated to potentially illuminate trends in the changes in price of single family homes across neighborhoods. 

# Materials and methods

[~ 200 words]

Narrative: Clear narrative description of the data sources and methods. Includes data from at least two sources that were integrated / merged in R.

Code: The code associated with the project is well organized and easy to follow. Demonstrates mastery of R graphics and functions.

Data: The underlying data are publicly accessible via the web and downloaded/accessed within the Rmd script. If you want to use your own data, you must make it available on a website (e.g. Figshare) so that others are able to re-run your code.

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.

# Results

[~200 words]

Tables and figures (maps and other graphics) are carefully planned to convey the results of your analysis. Intense exploration and evidence of many trials and failures. The author looked at the data in many different ways before coming to the final presentation of the data.

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

```{r}
# 2017 - 2018 Single Family Housing Price Histogram
Plot_2017 <- ggplot(data = Buffalo_17, mapping = aes(x = TOTAL.VALUE)) + 
  geom_histogram() + xlab("Total Property Value($)") + ylab("Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values="lightblue") + theme_few() +
  labs(x="Total Value($)", y="Count", title="Distribution of Buffalo Home Prices",
       subtitle="Single Family Property Prices (2019 - 2020)", 
       caption="Source: Buffalo Open Data") + scale_x_continuous() + scale_y_continuous()
plot(Plot_2017)
```


```{r}
# 2019 - 2020 Single Family Housing Price Histogram
Plot_2019 <- ggplot(data = Buffalo_20, mapping = aes(x = TOTAL.VALUE)) + 
  geom_histogram() + xlab("Total Property Value($)") + ylab("Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values="lightblue") + theme_few() +
  labs(x="Total Value($)", y="Count", title="Distribution of Buffalo Home Prices",
       subtitle="Single Family Property Prices (2019 - 2020)", 
       caption="Source: Buffalo Open Data") + scale_x_continuous() + scale_y_continuous()
plot(Plot_2019)
```

```{r}
#Data is transformed using Natural Log for Map Visualization
Buffalo_17$logprice <- log(Buffalo_17$TOTAL.VALUE)
Buffalo_20$logprice <- log(Buffalo_20$TOTAL.VALUE)
```

```{r}
#Buffalo Bounding Box
Buffalo_bbox <- Buffalo_sp@bbox

# Download the basemap
basemap <- get_stamenmap(
  bbox = Buffalo_bbox,
  zoom = 13,
  maptype = "toner-lite")

# View Map
BFMap <- ggmap(basemap) + 
  labs(title="Buffalo Basemap")
BFMap
```

```{r}
# 2017 - 2018 Assessment Roll Plot
SingleFam17 <- ggmap(basemap) + 
  geom_point(data = Buffalo_17, aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, color = logprice), 
             size = .025, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_gradient("Single Family Home Price", 
                        low = "light green", high = "dark green") +

       subtitle="Property Prices (2017 - 2018)",

             size = .025, alpha = 0.7) +
